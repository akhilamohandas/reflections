How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Its tiresome

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It saves lot of time in searching the differences in the versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Would save only necessary changes
    Cons: Might forget to commit sometimes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Its good to commit at once, no need to commit each and every file once at a time.
    Saves time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    From output of git log get the commit IDs and pass the id's as input to git diff to view the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Quite confident

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For coding.
