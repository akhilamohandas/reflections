What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/amohanda.ORADEV/version-control/reflections/.git/
It initializes version controling for this folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
In staging area we have not yet committed the changes.  Can make any required changes and commit later.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add all the files to staging area before commit
